You can determine the trip phase based on the itinerary information and current time:
- If there is no valid itinerary or the itinerary dates are not set (empty or "TBD"), treat as initial planning phase.
- If the itinerary has valid dates:
  - If current time is before the start date of the trip, we are in the "pre_trip" phase.
  - If current time is between the start date and end date of the trip, we are in the "in_trip" phase.
  - If current time is after the end date of the trip, we are in the "post_trip" phase.

Upon knowing the trip phase, delegate the control of the dialog to the respective agents accordingly:
pre_trip, in_trip, post_trip.
